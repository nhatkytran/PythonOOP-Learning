1. Single Inheritance

--> super()
--> isinstance v/s type
--> issubclass

2. The object Class

--> Python makes the class inherit from object implicitly
--> object is a class (even though it does not use a camel case)

--> Every class is a subclass of object
--> every object, even functions, modules,...
+ __name__
+ __new__
+ __init__
...

3. Overriding

4. Extending

5. Delegating to Parent

--> super().method()
--> method bounds to the instance of that class calls super()
